Questions:
1. You have a file with permissions -rw-r--r--, and you run chmod +x file.sh. What happens?
    The execute permission is added to all the user groups => -rwxr-xr-x

2. What is the difference between chmod 744 file.txt and chmod u=rwx,go=r file.txt?
    Both perform the same operation with different syntax

3. What is the sticky bit, and when should you use it?
    A sticky bit is a flag set to a directory, so that even if write access is given to a user, only the owner can *delete* the data. This is useful in shared systems

4. You are told to give the owner full access, group only execute, and others no permissions. What symbolic command achieves this?
    chmod 710 <filename>

5. What is umask, and why is it important?
    umask is a value that is subtracted from the default chmod value , whenever a new file or folder is created
      new file permissions = 666 - umask
      new folder pemissions = 777 - umask

6. If the umask is 022, what are the default permissions for a new file and a new directory?
    new file = 666 - 022 = 644 (-rw-r--r--)
    new folder = 777 - 022 = 755 (-rwxr-xr-x)

7. Why is umask often set to 002 in development environments but 027 or 077 in production?
    umask of 002 provides full access to owners and groups, for easy collaboration and testing
    but in production, the data must not be modified for safety and security. so 027 => provides write access to groups and NO access to others
    and 077 only allows the owner user to read, write and execute.

8. useradd vs adduser
    useradd is a linux system binary packaged along with the kernel
    adduser is a debian high level wrapper for useradd functionalities
